# Dataset preprocessing files
The original dataset can be found on
    https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-cars-emission-18

The script to clean the dataset is 'clean.py'. Note that you would have to
download the csv files for the years 2015 to 2021. Also that they have to
be renamed to "CO2_<year>.csv" as this is hardcoded in 'clean.py'.

The script to transform the cleaned dataset into smaller csv files that are
used for the visualisations can be found in 'docs/test.ipynb'.

The file with the actual data story can be fonud in 'story.ipynb'.
